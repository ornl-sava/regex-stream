  "readme": "#Streams to assist testing Streams\n\nwriting streams can be difficult, one of the most difficult aspects can be testing them througherly.\n\nthat is where stream-tester comes in. \nstream-tester can be used to generate data to exercise your streams.\ncombine it with [stream-spec](https://github.com/dominictarr/stream-spec)\nwhich will validate your stream's behaviour and you've got a pretty easy test suite.\n\n## createRandomStream (generator, max)\n\ncreate a stream of random chunks. `generator` defaults to `Math.random`.\nemit `'end'` after `max` chunks. `max` defaults to `Infinity`\n\n## createIncStream (max)\n\ncreate a stream of increasing numbers, up to `max`\n\n## createPauseStream (prob, delay)\n\ncreate a through stream that randomly pauses\n(returns false from `write`). `prob` is the probability\nof a pause. `delay` is the time to wait before emitting `'drain'`. defaults are `prob=0.1`, and `delay` is next tick.\n",
